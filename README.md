digit and character recognition with model explainability

---

## what it is  
a machine learning system trained to recognize handwritten digits and characters 
interpreted with lime to show how and why each prediction is made.

---

## what it does  
- classifies digits using the MNIST dataset  
- recognizes characters via EMNIST  
- explains model decisions visually with LIME

---

## my part  
i contributed to the training pipeline — tuning models, refining evaluation,  
and interpreting outputs alongside lime explanations.

## datasets  
- **MNIST** – handwritten digits (0–9), 60k training / 10k test  
- **EMNIST** – handwritten letters and digits, multiple splits

---

## tools & tech  
- python, tensorflow  
- sklearn, keras  
- LIME (local interpretable model-agnostic explanations)

---

*some letters are read. others are understood.*
